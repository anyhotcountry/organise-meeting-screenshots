# Screenshot Buddy

I take a lot of screenshots during meetings, and they all end up in my Screenshots folder with names like `Screenshot (378).png`. Wouldn't it be good if I could associate the screenshots with the meetings when they were taken?

This is a simple command line utility that does that. It creates folders with the meeting names and then moves the screenshot files into the folders. This helps you to find screenshots more easily.
